A few ideas :

    Give the pros and cons of using a generator vs container where access to multiple related data items is required.
    Give an example of the difference between dunder_getattr and dunder_getattribute
    Explain the advantages of using dataclasses.
    Why would you want a custom class to implement dunder_getslice and dunder_setslice
    Can you explain the Python MRO and how the super() function fits into that.
    Give the pros and cons of using comprehensions vs explicit loops
    How does EAFP fit into to a Python coding style.
    Give the pros and cons of multithreading vs multiprocessing in Python.

These are just a sample - needless to say , if you can’t answer the questions yourself you shouldn’t be doing the interview (or you should have someone on your panel that can).
